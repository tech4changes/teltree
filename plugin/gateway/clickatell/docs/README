Incoming and outgoing SMS are done via HTTP API, an HTTP GET submitted to an HTTP/S URL

Register yourself at Clickatell's website, you have to create a new connection.

After creating the connection take note of your username, password, client ID and API ID
since those items are required to configure the gateway module.

Dont forget to point callback setting on Clickatell control panel, otherwise you won't be
able to track the status of your messages

Example of callback URL:

since 0.9.5.1 the URL should be:

prior to 0.9.5.1:
http://your_playsms_website/plugin/gateway/clickatell/callback.php
